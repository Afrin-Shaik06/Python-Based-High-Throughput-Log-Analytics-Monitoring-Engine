🚀 High Throughput Log Analytics & Monitoring System
📌 Overview

The High Throughput Log Analytics & Monitoring System is a distributed log processing platform designed to simulate how modern large-scale systems monitor and analyze application logs in real time.

The system generates large volumes of logs, processes them using distributed computing frameworks, detects anomalies, and visualizes system behavior through monitoring dashboards.

This project demonstrates key concepts used in real-world distributed monitoring systems such as scalable log pipelines, distributed processing, and anomaly detection.

The project is implemented in two milestones:

Milestone-1 – Architecture design and distributed computing simulation
Milestone-2 – Real-time log processing pipeline and monitoring dashboard

🧾 Milestone-2 Components
Distributed Cluster

dask_cluster.py

Initializes a distributed cluster for scalable log processing.

Log Generation

generate_logs.py

Generates simulated application logs for testing the pipeline.

Run:

python milestone-2/generate_logs.py
Log Ingestion

ingestion.py

Reads raw logs and prepares them for processing.

Log Processing

processing.py

Performs basic log analytics such as counting error logs.

Example functionality:

def process_logs(parsed_logs):
    error_count = 0
    for log in parsed_logs:
        if log["level"] == "ERROR":
            error_count += 1

    print("Total ERROR logs:", error_count)
    return error_count
Distributed Log Processing

dask_pipeline.py

Processes large log datasets using distributed computing.

Run:

python milestone-2/dask_pipeline.py
Anomaly Detection

anomaly_detection.py

Detects abnormal patterns within logs.

Run:

python milestone-2/anomaly_detection.py
Alerting System

alerting.py

Generates alerts when anomalies are detected.

Real-Time Log Simulation

realtime_ingestion.py

Simulates continuous log streaming.

📊 Monitoring Dashboard

The system provides a monitoring dashboard built using Streamlit.

Start the dashboard:

streamlit run milestone-2/dashboard.py

Open in browser:

http://localhost:8501

Features:

Real-time log visualization
System health monitoring
Interactive filtering
Log analytics charts
Anomaly tracking
📁 Output Files

Processed logs are stored in:

milestone-2/processed_logs/output.csv

Example fields include:

timestamp
log_level
service_name
log_message
anomaly_flag
🔮 Future Enhancements

Future improvements can extend the capabilities of this system.

Advanced Log Analytics Dashboard

Integration with Elasticsearch and Kibana can be expanded to build advanced analytics dashboards including:

Real-time log visualization
Advanced log search and filtering
Interactive monitoring dashboards
Trend analysis and alerting
Streaming Log Pipelines

Future Enhancements
1. Full Elasticsearch Integration

Currently, logs are visualized in Kibana, but the system can be enhanced by directly pushing processed logs from the pipeline into Elasticsearch for real-time indexing, querying, and analytics.

2. Real-Time Streaming Log Processing

Enhance the pipeline to process logs in real time using streaming frameworks instead of batch processing.

Example technologies:

Apache Kafka
Spark Streaming

This would allow continuous monitoring of system activity.

3. Advanced Anomaly Detection Models

Currently anomaly detection uses a Z-score statistical method. Future versions could include machine learning models such as:

Isolation Forest
LSTM-based anomaly detection
Autoencoders

to detect complex system failures.

4. Cloud Deployment

Deploy the monitoring engine on cloud platforms such as:

AWS
Azure
Google Cloud

to support large-scale distributed systems.

5. Alerting and Notification System

Add automated alerts when anomalies are detected.

Example integrations:

Email alerts
Slack notifications
PagerDuty
6. Interactive Dashboard Improvements

Enhance the **Streamlit dashboard with:

live log streaming
anomaly alert panels
advanced filtering options
